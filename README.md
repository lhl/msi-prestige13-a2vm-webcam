# MSI Prestige 13 AI+ Evo A2VMG Webcam Bring-Up

Research and bring-up notes for getting the built-in webcam working on Linux on
the MSI Prestige 13 AI+ Evo A2VMG / A2VM family.

## Current Status

**The webcam works on Linux, including in Chrome and Firefox.**

With `libcamera` + `pipewire-libcamera` installed, the camera is discovered
automatically as "Built-in Front Camera" — no manual bridge or background
process needed. libcamera's SoftwareISP handles debayering (GPU-accelerated)
and auto-exposure.

```bash
# Verify camera detection
cam -l    # -> "1: Internal front camera (\_SB_.LNK0)"

# Browser setup:
#   Chrome: enable chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-pipewire-camera
#   Firefox: set media.webrtc.camera.allow-pipewire = true in about:config
```

See [`docs/webcam-usage.md`](./docs/webcam-usage.md) for the full usage guide
including browser setup, exposure control, and the GStreamer fallback path.

- **Requires**: a kernel with the cleaned upstream 6-patch series or the
  older equivalent local bring-up stack booted; current local runtime
  validation is on `7.0.0-rc2-1-mainline-dirty`, plus `libcamera` +
  `libcamera-ipa` + `libcamera-tools`, `pipewire-libcamera`
- **Working**: Chrome (with PipeWire flag), Firefox (with PipeWire camera
  pref), auto-exposure via
  SoftwareISP, GPU-accelerated debayering, PipeWire camera integration,
  GStreamer live preview and snapshot capture
- **Not yet working**: `cheese`, direct `/dev/video0` plug-and-play,
  tuned IPA profile (using generic `uncalibrated.yaml`)
- Technical details: [`docs/webcam-status.md`](./docs/webcam-status.md)
- Full March 9 investigation report:
  [`docs/20260309-status-report.md`](./docs/20260309-status-report.md)
- Post-mortem on the March 9 miss vs the later Antti-style working path:
  [`docs/POST-MORTEM.md`](./docs/POST-MORTEM.md)

Machine under test:

- Model: `Prestige 13 AI+ Evo A2VMG`
- Revision: `REV:1.0`
- Latest recorded kernel: `7.0.0-rc2-1-mainline-dirty` on `2026-03-12`

## Resume Codex

From this repo root, the quickest way back into the latest investigation
session is:

```bash
cd /home/lhl/github/lhl/msi-prestige13-a2vm-webcam
codex resume --last
```

Useful variants:

- `codex resume` — open the session picker filtered to the current working tree
- `codex resume --all` — show all recorded sessions, not just this repo/CWD
- `codex resume <SESSION_ID>` — resume a specific session UUID directly

## Working Conventions

- `README.md` stays accurate and points to the current doc structure.
- `PLAN.md` is the forward-looking source of truth for open questions and next
  steps.
- `WORKLOG.md` records every meaningful work session, including commands,
  evidence, and outcomes.
- `scripts/webcam-run.sh` is the safe harness for repeatable snapshot and
  reprobe runs.
- `scripts/capture-acpi.sh` is the root-only ACPI capture helper for this exact
  machine.
- `scripts/extract-iactrllogic64.sh` regenerates the checked-in Windows
  control-logic analysis artifacts.
- `scripts/patch-kernel.sh` applies the baseline patch profile repeatably.
- `scripts/exp*-*-update.sh` and `scripts/exp*-*-verify.sh` are the current
  PMIC experiment entrypoints.
- `runs/` stores timestamped run outputs from the harness and experiment
  wrappers.
- `state/CONTEXT.md` is the one-screen restart capsule for the next session.
- `reference/` holds captured external sources with stable filenames, source
  URLs, and capture dates.
- `docs/` holds synthesized conclusions and current state-of-project documents.

## Current Focus

1. Treat the completed March 9 PMIC batch as the new baseline evidence, not as
   future work.
2. Keep the current tested stack fixed:
   - MSI `INT3472` / `TPS68470` board-data
   - `ipu-bridge` `OVTI5675`
   - `ov5675` serial power-on order
3. Use the completed negative branches to stop spending time on blind GPIO
   permutations:
   - label-only `GPIO1` / `GPIO2` swap
   - both one-line polarity variants
   - three staged `ov5675` GPIO-release variants
   - `exp5` `WF` GPIO mode follow-up
   - `exp6` `UF` / `gpio.4` last resort
4. Treat `exp13` through `exp18` as completed evidence.
   - `exp13` proved Linux can leave `GPIO1` / `GPIO2` in daisy-chain input
     mode
   - `exp14` proved `GPIO9` is active, but insufficient as a lone reset line
   - `exp15` proved `GPIO7` is also active, but insufficient as a lone reset
     line
   - `exp16` proved the current-driver `GPIO7` / `GPIO9` approximation can
     drive both remote lines together, but is still insufficient
   - `exp17` proved a later `S_I2C_CTL BIT(0)` on the clean remote-line branch
     is safe and reads back as `0x03`, but still does not move the sensor off
     repeated `-121`
   - `exp18` proved stock regulator-side `VSIO` enable is safe on the clean
     daisy-chain branch and yields the first `ov5675 10-0036` sensor entity in
     the media graph
5. Keep `exp10` only as the older PMIC control baseline.
   - `exp11` showed that one modeled late `BIT(0)` hook still re-wedges PMIC
     access
   - `exp12` showed that the low-effort Antti-inspired daisy-chain setup is
     immediately overridden by the current Linux `GPIO1` / `GPIO2` lookup
   - `exp13` through `exp18` then showed the clean daisy-chain branch is real,
     both remote lines are active, standard `VSIO` is safe there, and sensor
     bind is now possible
6. Use `exp18` as the current best local branch for follow-up validation.
   - standard `VSIO` now reads back cleanly as `0x03`
   - the old timeout storm does not return
   - the media graph now contains `ov5675 10-0036`
7. Use `scripts/06-media-pipeline-setup.sh` as the current capture truth
   source.
   - the latest fresh-boot rerun confirms the real boot default is
     `Intel IPU7 CSI2 0` at `4096x3072` with `CSI2:1 -> Capture 0` disabled
   - steps 2-5 of the script change the working path to `2592x1944`,
     enable the capture link, and let `/dev/video0` stream raw Bayer frames
8. Use `scripts/07-normal-usage-check.sh` as the current auto-negotiated
   higher-level client compatibility truth source.
   - latest result:
     - `ffmpeg`: `VIDIOC_STREAMON` `Broken pipe`
     - `mpv`: same `Broken pipe` path through FFmpeg's V4L2 demuxer
     - GStreamer `v4l2src`: buffer-pool activation failed, then
       `not-negotiated`
     - `libcamera` tools: missing locally
9. Use `scripts/08-userspace-bridge-check.sh` as the current explicit
   userspace-bridge truth source.
   - latest result:
     - direct `YUYV` still fails at `VIDIOC_STREAMON` / negotiation
     - GStreamer with explicit `video/x-bayer,format=grbg10le` succeeds
     - `bayer2rgb` + `videoconvert` succeeds
     - a normal `2592x1944` JPEG artifact can be emitted from that path
10. Use `scripts/09-libcamera-loopback-check.sh` as the next-step integration
    truth source for both `libcamera` and `v4l2loopback`.
   - latest local result:
     - `libcamera` tools are still missing
     - the `v4l2loopback` bridge is consumer-facing when `/dev/video42` is
       present
     - `ffmpeg` and GStreamer both consumed the bridged `YUY2` stream from
       `/dev/video42`
     - the remaining work is packaging that bridge for normal apps and fixing
       the underlying warning/direct-format issues
11. Investigate the remaining `Received packet is too long` warnings as a
   geometry-alignment issue.
   - current hard clue: `bytesused = 10,077,696` while
     `Size Image = 10,082,880`
   - the `5,184`-byte delta is exactly one scanline at the current
     `Bytes per Line = 5,184`
12. Treat post-boot PMIC visibility as secondary to capture/client cleanup now
    that raw streaming works.

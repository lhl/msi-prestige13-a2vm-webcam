# MSI Prestige 13 AI+ Evo A2VMG Webcam Bring-Up

Research and bring-up notes for getting the built-in webcam working on Linux on
the MSI Prestige 13 AI+ Evo A2VMG / A2VM family.

## Current Status

- Current verdict: the webcam is still not working end to end.
- Best current summary: `docs/webcam-status.md`
- Full March 9 status report: `docs/20260309-status-report.md`
- Current leading blocker: `exp18` now binds `ov5675 10-0036` into the media
  graph with stock regulator-side `VSIO = 0x03`, so the remaining gap is no
  longer first sensor wake-up; `exp19` shows the first raw userspace stream on
  `/dev/video0` now fails later at `VIDIOC_STREAMON` with `Link has been
  severed`, plus broken post-boot PMIC visibility.
- Current leading interpretation: the clean daisy-chain branch plus standard
  `VSIO` is the first positive local baseline, and any remaining Antti-thread
  drift is now more likely to matter for cleanup/upstreamability than for basic
  sensor bring-up.

Machine under test:

- Model: `Prestige 13 AI+ Evo A2VMG`
- Revision: `REV:1.0`
- Latest recorded kernel: `7.0.0-rc2-1-mainline-dirty` on `2026-03-09`

## Resume Codex

From this repo root, the quickest way back into the latest investigation
session is:

```bash
cd /home/lhl/github/lhl/msi-prestige13-a2vm-webcam
codex resume --last
```

Useful variants:

- `codex resume` — open the session picker filtered to the current working tree
- `codex resume --all` — show all recorded sessions, not just this repo/CWD
- `codex resume <SESSION_ID>` — resume a specific session UUID directly

## Working Conventions

- `README.md` stays accurate and points to the current doc structure.
- `PLAN.md` is the forward-looking source of truth for open questions and next
  steps.
- `WORKLOG.md` records every meaningful work session, including commands,
  evidence, and outcomes.
- `scripts/webcam-run.sh` is the safe harness for repeatable snapshot and
  reprobe runs.
- `scripts/capture-acpi.sh` is the root-only ACPI capture helper for this exact
  machine.
- `scripts/extract-iactrllogic64.sh` regenerates the checked-in Windows
  control-logic analysis artifacts.
- `scripts/patch-kernel.sh` applies the baseline patch profile repeatably.
- `scripts/exp*-*-update.sh` and `scripts/exp*-*-verify.sh` are the current
  PMIC experiment entrypoints.
- `runs/` stores timestamped run outputs from the harness and experiment
  wrappers.
- `state/CONTEXT.md` is the one-screen restart capsule for the next session.
- `reference/` holds captured external sources with stable filenames, source
  URLs, and capture dates.
- `docs/` holds synthesized conclusions and current state-of-project documents.

## Current Focus

1. Treat the completed March 9 PMIC batch as the new baseline evidence, not as
   future work.
2. Keep the current tested stack fixed:
   - MSI `INT3472` / `TPS68470` board-data
   - `ipu-bridge` `OVTI5675`
   - `ov5675` serial power-on order
3. Use the completed negative branches to stop spending time on blind GPIO
   permutations:
   - label-only `GPIO1` / `GPIO2` swap
   - both one-line polarity variants
   - three staged `ov5675` GPIO-release variants
   - `exp5` `WF` GPIO mode follow-up
   - `exp6` `UF` / `gpio.4` last resort
4. Treat `exp13` through `exp18` as completed evidence.
   - `exp13` proved Linux can leave `GPIO1` / `GPIO2` in daisy-chain input
     mode
   - `exp14` proved `GPIO9` is active, but insufficient as a lone reset line
   - `exp15` proved `GPIO7` is also active, but insufficient as a lone reset
     line
   - `exp16` proved the current-driver `GPIO7` / `GPIO9` approximation can
     drive both remote lines together, but is still insufficient
   - `exp17` proved a later `S_I2C_CTL BIT(0)` on the clean remote-line branch
     is safe and reads back as `0x03`, but still does not move the sensor off
     repeated `-121`
   - `exp18` proved stock regulator-side `VSIO` enable is safe on the clean
     daisy-chain branch and yields the first `ov5675 10-0036` sensor entity in
     the media graph
5. Keep `exp10` only as the older PMIC control baseline.
   - `exp11` showed that one modeled late `BIT(0)` hook still re-wedges PMIC
     access
   - `exp12` showed that the low-effort Antti-inspired daisy-chain setup is
     immediately overridden by the current Linux `GPIO1` / `GPIO2` lookup
   - `exp13` through `exp18` then showed the clean daisy-chain branch is real,
     both remote lines are active, standard `VSIO` is safe there, and sensor
     bind is now possible
6. Use `exp18` as the current best local branch for follow-up validation.
   - standard `VSIO` now reads back cleanly as `0x03`
   - the old timeout storm does not return
   - the media graph now contains `ov5675 10-0036`
7. Use `exp19` plus `scripts/04-userspace-capture-check.sh` as the next
   reproducible step.
   - reuse the positive `exp18` patch unchanged
   - the first `/dev/video0` stream attempt now reaches `VIDIOC_STREAMON`
     and fails there with `Link has been severed`
8. Treat post-boot PMIC visibility as secondary to the new userspace
   `STREAMON` failure until the capture-path result is understood.
